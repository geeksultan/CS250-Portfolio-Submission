# CS250-Portfolio-Submission
Portfolio submission for CS 250 â€” Sprint Review, Retrospective, and README reflection.

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them?
I interpret user needs by collaborating closely with the Product Owner and reviewing user stories during sprint planning and backlog refinement sessions. I focus on clarifying acceptance criteria early, breaking down requirements into actionable tasks, and regularly seeking feedback through sprint reviews to ensure the final product aligns with user expectations.

2. How do I approach developing programs with Agile?
I approach program development by embracing Agile principles such as iterative delivery, continuous feedback, and adaptability. I prioritize tasks from the backlog, participate in daily standups to track progress, adjust priorities as needed during sprints, and conduct retrospectives to continuously improve both the product and our team processes.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member?
Being a good team member means communicating openly, being adaptable, offering support when others face challenges, and taking ownership of assigned tasks. It also involves actively participating in sprint events, being receptive to feedback, and working collaboratively toward the shared goal of delivering high-quality software.
